FAQ:

<b>Q: What works?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> You can move around and fight other players if you want to, but it's still buggy and prone to crashes. <i>The server is still in early development so things will change.</i>

<b>Q: Can I play yet?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> You can download the latest version and compile it for testing but no guarantee on stability.
You can log in and move around with other players as of writing this.
